# Machine Learning Sessional

This repository includes my implementations of core machine learning algorithms as part of the Machine Learning sessional course.

## üìö Topics Covered

- **Logistic Regression**  
  Binary classifier implemented from scratch using gradient descent.

- **AdaBoost**  
  Boosting ensemble method built using decision stumps to improve weak learners.

- **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)**  
  Custom multi-layer neural network with backpropagation and activation functions.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
  Dimensionality reduction using eigen decomposition of the covariance matrix.

- **Expectation-Maximization (EM)**  
  Implemented EM algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Models to cluster unlabeled data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools

- Python  
- NumPy (no high-level ML libraries used)
